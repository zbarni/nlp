			20 newsgroups dataset
			---------------------

This  is  a  collection  of  about  20,000  UseNet  postings  from  20
newsgroups,  gathered by Ken  Lang at  CMU in  the mid-90's.   In this
directory you  will find the  training set (20news.tr), the  test set,
(20news.te)  and  a vocabulary  file  (20news.voc).  The training  set
consists  of  the  first  80%   of  the  messages  of  each  group  in
chronological order.  Both the  training and test  set files  have the
same  format,   with  each  line  representing  a   document.  In  the
preprocessing only  the subject  and the text  of the mails  was taken
into  account (i.e.  no  headers  and no  binary  data) and  stopwords
(articles, prepositions, etc.) were  removed.  The first field in each
line is the name of the  document (the path in the original data), the
second one  the class of  the document, and  the rest of the  line are
several pairs of the form  <word> <wordcount>.  The vocabulary file is
simply a list  of words, ordered by importance  for the classification
(information gain).

The newsgroups present in the corpus (i.e. the classes) are:
  alt.atheism
  comp.graphics
  comp.os.ms-windows.misc
  comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
  comp.sys.mac.hardware
  comp.windows.x
  misc.forsale
  rec.autos
  rec.motorcycles
  rec.sport.baseball
  rec.sport.hockey
  sci.crypt
  sci.electronics
  sci.med
  sci.space
  soc.religion.christian
  talk.politics.guns
  talk.politics.mideast
  talk.politics.misc
  talk.religion.misc

Note that in the test set the  labels are included in order to be able
to   calculate  the   error  rate,   it  should   not   influence  the
classification process!
